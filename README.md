### [Task1](/lab1)
- [x] +1.0 – Write a script that takes 3 arguments: SOURCE_DIR, RM_LIST, TARGET_DIR with default values of lab_uno, 2remove, and bakap, respectively.

- [x] +0.5 – If TARGET_DIR does not exist, we create it.

- [x] +1.0 – We iterate through the contents of the RM_LIST file, and only if a file with that name exists in the SOURCE_DIR directory, we delete it.

- [x] +0.5 – If a file is not on the list but is a regular file, we move it to TARGET_DIR. 

- [x] +0.5 – If a file is not on the list but is a directory, we copy it to TARGET_DIR along with its contents.

- [x] +1.0  – If there are still any files in the SOURCE_DIR directory after the operation is completed, we output the number of such files.

 - [x] +0.5 – After all operations, compress the TARGET_DIR directory and name the resulting archive bakap_DATA.zip, where DATA is the date the script was run in the format YYYY-MM-DD.
