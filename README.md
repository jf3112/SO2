### [Laboratory 1](/lab1)
:heavy_check_mark: Write a script that takes 3 arguments: SOURCE_DIR, RM_LIST, TARGET_DIR with default values of lab_uno, 2remove, and bakap, respectively.

:heavy_check_mark: If TARGET_DIR does not exist, we create it.

:heavy_check_mark: We iterate through the contents of the RM_LIST file, and only if a file with that name exists in the SOURCE_DIR directory, we delete it.

:heavy_check_mark: If a file is not on the list but is a regular file, we move it to TARGET_DIR. 

:heavy_check_mark: If a file is not on the list but is a directory, we copy it to TARGET_DIR along with its contents.

:heavy_check_mark: If there are still any files in the SOURCE_DIR directory after the operation is completed, we output the number of such files.

:heavy_check_mark: After all operations, compress the TARGET_DIR directory and name the resulting archive bakap_DATA.zip, where DATA is the date the script was run in the format YYYY-MM-DD.

### [Laboratory 2](/lab2)

:heavy_check_mark: Task 1

:heavy_check_mark: Task 2

### Laboratory 3

##### Task 1

:heavy_check_mark: Find 10 unique IP addresses in the access_log file.

:heavy_check_mark: Find requests in the access_log file that contain the phrase "denied" in the link.

:heavy_check_mark: Find requests in the access_log file that were sent from the IP address: 64.242.88.10.

:heavy_check_mark: Find unique requests of type DELETE in the access_log file.

##### Task 2

:heavy_check_mark: Print all those whose id is an odd number. Save the results to the standard error output.

:heavy_check_mark: From the file yolo.csv, print each IP number that has one digit in the first and second octet. Save the results to the standard error output.

##### Task 3

:heavy_check_mark: In all files in the 'groovies' directory, replace $HEADER$ with /subject/.

:heavy_check_mark: In all files in the 'groovies' directory, remove lines containing the phrase 'Help docs:'.

##### Task 4

:heavy_check_mark: Run the script fakaping.sh, redirect the standard output to null, and sort the errors (without removing duplicates).

:heavy_check_mark: Run the script fakaping.sh, capture all errors containing 'permission denied' (case-insensitive), print them to the console, and save them to the file denied.log. Results should be unique.

:heavy_check_mark: Run the script fakaping.sh and save all unique lines to the file all.log and print them to the console.
